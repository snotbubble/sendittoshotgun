One-click Shotgun submit script.

Still quite valuable, so will release the script when Shotgun becomes obsolete.

Script allows submission of imagery to Shotgun without having to install Shotgun or any middleware.  The goal was to solve a pipeline problem rather than milk it, so this approach is still unpopular (& sometimes despised) where a pipeline department is already established.
